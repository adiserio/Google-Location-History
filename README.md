# Google-Location-History
In this project, I explore the location data Google has collected about me since June 2011 thru February 2020.

The Google Location History (GLH) can be downloaded from your Google account under https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout. The data provided by Google for download is a .json file and can be loaded using the jsonlite package. Loading this file into R might take a few minutes. It depends on how many location points Google had saved about you
